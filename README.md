This is a modified version of Pure CSS avaliable in http://purecss.io/ . Based on Pure v0.6.0, Copyright 2014 Yahoo! Inc. All rights reserved. Licensed under the BSD License. https://github.com/yahoo/pure/blob/master/LICENSE.md
The changes made were:
- Include a new classes "xx" to improve better support to screens HD and FullHD;
- Include the class "xl" in old Internet Explorer grid hacks (grids-responsive-old-ie-min.css);
- The minimum width of the classes has changed for most: sm:36em; md:54em; lg:72em; xl:90em; end the new classes xx:108em.
- Remove the prefix "pure-" in the name of classes, for better agility.
- The class ".menu" was menu to ".nav" to have more coherence with html5, where the "menu" tag has another function.
- Remove obsolete vendor prefixes, such as "-moz-box-sizing" and "webkit-box-sizing".
